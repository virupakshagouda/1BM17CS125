          Python history
Python 2.0 was first released in 2000. Its latest version, 2.7, was released in 2010.
Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Its newest version, 3.6, was released in 2016, and version 3.7 is currently in development.
Although Python 2.7 is still widely used, Python 3 adoption is growing quickly. In 2016, 71.9% of projects used Python 2.7,
but by 2017, it had fallen to 63.7%. This signals that the programming community is turning to Python 3–albeit gradually–when 
developing real-world applications.
